1,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke."
2,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,Al brings a wealth of experience to Financial Network. His depth of experience with a variety of securities organizations can only help us improve our already strong compliance culture.
3,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition."
4,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Any man, in the right situation, is capable of murder. But not any man is capable of being a good camper. So, murder and camping are not as similar as you might think."
5,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,Anybody who has an identity problem had better wise up and get with the program!
6,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing."
7,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"As a young boy, when you get splashed by a mud puddle on the way to school, you wonder if you should go home and change, but be late for school, or go to school the way you are; dirty and soaking wet. Well, while he tried to decide, I drove by and splashed him again."
8,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!"
9,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint."
11,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"As we were driving, we saw a sign that said Watch for Rocks. Marta said it should read Watch for Pretty Rocks. I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!"
12,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up"
13,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Broken promises don't upset me. I just think, why did they believe me?"
14,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling."
16,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff."
17,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis."
18,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not putting on your armor because you were just going down to the corner."
19,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered that they were not Indians at all but only dirty-clothes hampers."
20,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, Think again, bat man."
21,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Folks still remember the day ole Bob Riley came bouncing down that dirt road in his pickup. Pretty soon, it was bouncing higher and higher. The tires popped, and the shocks broke, but that truck kept bouncing. Some say it bounced clean over the moon, but whoever says that is a goddamn liar."
23,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?"
24,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, Dust to dust, some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."
25,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know anybody: First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out too. Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy."
26,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak"
27,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex."
28,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I bet for an Indian, shooting an old fat pioneer woman in the back with an arrow, and she fires her shotgun into the ground as she falls over, is like the top thing you can do."
29,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I bet it's hard to break farmers of the old superstitions like Tornado got Old Yeller, stay in the cellar."
30,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye."
31,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and go, What was THAT?!"
32,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I bet when neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, 'Don't forget the thick, heavy brows.' Then they would get all embarrassed because they remembered they had the big husky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman."
33,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it."
34,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I don't like small birds. They hop around so merrily outside my window, looking so innocent. but I know that secretly, they're watching my every move and plotting to beat me over the head with a large steel pipe and take my shoe."
35,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system.
37,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet."
39,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I guess more bad things have been done in the name of progress than any other. I myself have been guilty of this. When I was a teenager, I stole a car and drove it out into the desert and set it on fire. When the police showed up, I just shrugged and said, Hey, progress. Boy, did I have a lot to learn."
40,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, I helped skin Bob."
42,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I have to laugh when I think of the first cigar, because it was probably just a bunch of rolled up tobacco leaves"
43,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I hope if dogs take over the world, and they choose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good ideas."
44,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it."
45,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I hope that someday we will be able to put away our fears and prejudices and just laugh at people.
46,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint."
47,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. You don't have to tell me, I said. I'm off the team, aren't I? Well, said Coach, you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times. It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on."
48,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting. That was fun, I said. You bet it was, said Nick. Let's climb higher. No, I said. I think we should be heading back now. We have time, Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we did. We argued back and forth like that for about 20 minutes, then finally decided to head back. I didn't say it was an interesting story."
49,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I think a good product would be Baby Duck Hat. It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then all of the sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man those ducks really take off! Also Baby Duck Hat is good for parties."
51,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me.
52,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks.
53,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur."
54,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality."
55,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I think the monkeys at the zoo should have to wear sunglasses so they can't hypnotize you.
56,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad."
57,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then, Yahoo!, I'd have all my money back."
58,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wish I had a kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula and Superman away"
59,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I was thinking about doing that anyway."
60,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds with my name on it."
62,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy - something like that."
63,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by meteorites and not even feel it."
64,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a fish out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the ground, and the fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that's a documentary."
66,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,I'd rather be rich than stupid.
67,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is God is crying. And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is Probably because of something you did."
68,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the dentist. When they started drilling, he'd probably go nuts and start eating everybody. That Alien!"
69,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If any man says he hates war more than I do, he better have a knife, that's all I have to say"
71,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If God dwells inside us like some people say, I sure hope He likes enchiladas, because that's what He's getting"
73,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like now."
74,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the impression we are trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control."
75,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If I had a mine shaft, I don't think I would just abandon it. There's got to be a better way."
76,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron! and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice. Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink."
77,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons (maybe by shoving them down his throat)."
78,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If they have moving sidewalks in the future, when you get on them, I think you should have to assume sort of a walking shape so as not to frighten the dogs."
79,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."
80,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward."
81,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic."
82,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let 'em go, because man, they're gone."
83,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy."
84,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever have to steal money from your kid, and later on he discovers it's gone, I think a good thing to do is to blame it on Santa Claus."
85,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose."
86,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet you could shoot beer out of you nose."
87,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that."
89,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude. That's a common mistake. You have to let nudity happen."
91,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you go flying back through time, and you see somebody else flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact."
92,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming."
93,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you think a good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife? Trust me, it's not."
94,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you go to a party, and you want to be the popular one at the party, do this: Wait until no one is looking, then kick a burning log out of the fireplace onto the carpet. Then jump on top of it with your body and yell, Log o' fire! Log o' fire! I've never done this, but I think it'd work."
95,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I bet the most common question people would ask is, Can't you make it shoot farther? No, I'm sorry. That's as far as it shoots."
96,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you lose your job, your marriage and your mind all in one week, try to lose your mind first, because then the other stuff won't matter that much."
97,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong though. It's Hambone."
99,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you think a weakness can be turned into a strength, I hate to tell you this, but that's another weakness."
100,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you want to be the most popular person in your class, whenever the professor pauses in his lecture, just let out a big snort and say, 'How do you figger that!' real loud. Then lean back and sort of smirk."
101,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, I swallowed it. So sue me."
102,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse, I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading a magazine."
103,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away."
104,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, Boy, these are good cigars!"
105,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you."
106,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them."
107,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny."
108,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to teach him to do some tricks. But only if you're serious about adopting the vulture."
109,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"In some places it's known as a tornado. In others, a cyclone. And in still others, the Idiot's Merry-go-round. But around here they'll always be known as screw-boys."
111,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window."
112,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Instead of having answers on a math test, they should just call them impressions, and if you got a different impression, so what, can't we all be brothers?"
113,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Instead of studying for finals, what about just going to the Bahamas and catching some rays? Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway; that's my point."
115,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have."
116,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk."
117,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,It's amazing to me that one of the world's most feared diseases would be carried by one of the world's smallest animals: the real tiny dog.
118,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"It's interesting to think that my ancestors used to live in the trees, like apes, until finally they got the nerve to head out onto the plains, where some were probably hit by cars"
119,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets its wings. But what they don't tell you is that every time you hear a mouse trap snap, an angel gets set on fire."
120,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so why not mate for life?"
121,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Laugh, clown, laugh. This is what I tell myself whenever I dress up like Bozo."
122,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Laurie got offended that I used the word puke. But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like."
123,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a direct hit from a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull and you pull, but you can't get the rock out of the ground. So you give it a good kick, but you lose your balance and go skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because they thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of there, but you start faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and then he gets mad and chases you..."
124,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Love can sweep you off your feet and carry you along in a way you've never known before. But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and bitter. Wait. It's not love I'm describing. I'm thinking of a monorail."
125,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it dull that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull?"
127,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Marta says the interesting thing about fly-fishing is that it's two lives connected by a thin strand. Come on, Marta. Grow up."
128,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Marta was watching the football game with me when she said, You know, most of these sports are based on the idea of one group protecting its territory from invasion by another group. Yeah, I said, trying not to laugh. Girls are funny."
129,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself:Mankind. Basically, it's made up of two separate words - mank and ind.What do these words mean? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind."
130,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your little window and think, Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that."
131,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer."
132,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Of all the tall tales, I think my favorite is the one about Eli Whitney and the interchangeable parts."
133,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,One thing a computer can do that most humans can't is be sealed up in a cardboard box and sit in a warehouse
134,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. Oh, no, I said. Disneyland burned down. He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late."
135,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"One thing vampire children are taught is, never run with a wooden stake"
136,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Perhaps, if I am very lucky, the feeble efforts of my lifetime will someday be noticed, and maybe, in some small way, they will be acknowledged as the greatest works of genius ever created by Man"
137,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
138,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
140,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Probably the saddest thing you'll ever see is a mosquito sucking on a mummy. Forget it, little friend."
141,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you."
142,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights,even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door."
143,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that I forgot to put on my pants"
145,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says You. After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done."
146,Deep Thought,230,jack_handey,"Sometimes you have to be careful when selecting a new name for yourself. For instance, let's say you have chosen the nickname Fly Head. Normally you would think that fly Head would mean a person who has beautiful swept-back features, as if flying through the air. But think again. Couldn't it also mean having a head like a fly? I'm afraid some people might actually think that."
