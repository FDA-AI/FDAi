### Automatic Location and Weather Logging (Optional)
By automatically recording your location in the background using GPS, we might be able to figure out how the 
amount of time spent at the gym, restaurants, doctors, offices, home, and work locations may be affecting you.   
Logging location enables weather logging to determine how things like temperature and sunlight exposure might 
be affecting you.  Another benefit of enabling this option is that allows the app to run in the background and 
open instantly instead of taking a few seconds to load.  You can view your location history by going to 
Menu -> History -> Locations.
