# 😕 Why are we doing this?

The current system of clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment is failing the billions of people are suffering from chronic diseases.

# 🧪 Our Hypothesis

By harnessing global collective intelligence and oceans of real-world data we hope to emulate Wikipedia's speed of knowledge generation. 

<details>
  <summary>👉 How to generate discoveries 50X faster and 1000X cheaper than current systems...</summary>

## Global Scale Clinical Research + Collective Intelligence = 🤯

So in the 90's, Microsoft spent billions hiring thousands of PhDs to create Encarta, the greatest encyclopedia in history.  A decade later, when Wikipedia was created, the general consensus was that it was going to be a dumpster fire of lies.  Surprisingly, Wikipedia ended up generating information 50X faster than Encarta and was about 1000X cheaper without any loss in accuracy.  This is the magical power of crowdsourcing and open collaboration.

Our crazy theory is that we can accomplish the same great feat in the realm of clinical research.  By crowdsourcing real-world data and observations from patients, clinicians, and researchers, we hope to generate clinical discoveries 50X faster and 1000X cheaper than current systems.

## The Potential of Real-World Evidence-Based Studies

- **Diagnostics** - Data mining and analysis to identify causes of illness
- **Preventative medicine** - Predictive analytics and data analysis of genetic, lifestyle, and social circumstances
  to prevent disease
- **Precision medicine** - Leveraging aggregate data to drive hyper-personalized care
- **Medical research** - Data-driven medical and pharmacological research to cure disease and discover new treatments and medicines
- **Reduction of adverse medication events** - Harnessing of big data to spot medication errors and flag potential
  adverse reactions
- **Cost reduction** - Identification of value that drives better patient outcomes for long-term savings
- **Population health** - Monitor big data to identify disease trends and health strategies based on demographics,
  geography, and socioeconomic

# 🖥️ FDAi Framework Components

This is a very high-level overview of the architecture. The 3 primary primitive components of the FDAi framework are:

1. [Data Silo API Gateway Nodes](#1-data-silo-api-gateway-nodes) that facilitate data export from data silos
2. [PersonalFDA Nodes](#2-personalfda-nodes) that import, store, and analyze your data to identify how various factors affect your health
3. [Clinipedia](#3-clinipediathe-wikipedia-of-clinical-research) that contains the aggregate of all available data on the effects of every food, drug, supplement, and medical intervention on human health.

The core characteristics that define the FDAi are:
- **Modularity** - a set of modular libraries and tools that can be reused in any project
- **Protocols** - an abstract framework of core primitive components rather than a specific implementation
- **Interoperability** - a directory of existing open-source projects that can be used to fulfill the requirements of each primitive or component
- **Collective Intelligence** - a collaborative effort, so please feel free to [contribute or edit anything](docs/contributing.md)!

## 1. Data Silo API Gateway Nodes

![dfda-gateway-api-node-silo.png](docs/components/data-silo-gateway-api-nodes/dfda-gateway-api-node-silo.png)

[FDAi Gateway API Nodes](docs/components/data-silo-gateway-api-nodes) should make it easy for data silos, such as hospitals and digital health apps, to let people export and save their data locally in their [PersonalFDA Nodes](#2-personalfda-nodes).

**👉 [Learn More About Gateway APIs](docs/components/data-silo-gateway-api-nodes/data-silo-api-gateways.md)**

## 2. PersonalFDA Nodes

[PersonalFDA Nodes](docs/components/personal-fda-nodes/personal-fda-nodes.md) are applications that can run on your phone or computer. They import, store, and analyze your data to identify how various factors affect your health.  They can also be used to share anonymous analytical results with the [Clinipedia FDAi Wiki](#3-clinipediathe-wikipedia-of-clinical-research) in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

[PersonalFDA Nodes](docs/components/personal-fda-nodes/personal-fda-nodes.md) are composed of two components, a [Digital Twin Safe](docs/components/digital-twin-safe/digital-twin-safe.md) and a [personal AI agent](docs/components/optimiton-ai-agent/optomitron-ai-agent.md) applies causal inference algorithms to estimate how various factors affect your health.

### 2.1. Digital Twin Safes

![digital-twin-safe-no-text.png](docs/components/digital-twin-safe/digital-twin-safe-no-text.png)aider

A local application for self-sovereign import and storage of personal data.

## 3. Clinipedia—The Wikipedia of Clinical Research

[![clinipedia_globe_circle.png](docs/components/clinipedia/clinipedia_globe_circle.png)](docs/components/clinipedia/clinipedia.md)

The [Clinipedia wiki](docs/components/clinipedia/clinipedia.md) should be a global knowledge repository containing the aggregate of all available data on the effects of every food, drug, supplement, and medical intervention on human health.

**[👉 Learn More or Contribute to the Clinipedia](docs/components/clinipedia/clinipedia.md)**

### 3.1 Outcome Labels

A key component of Clinipedia are [**Outcome Labels**](docs/components/outcome-labels/outcome-labels.md) that list the degree to which the product is likely to improve or worsen specific health outcomes or symptoms.

# Why a Monorepo?

Our goal is to develop [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)](docs/contributing/fair.md) data and analytical tools that can be used by any regulatory agencies, businesses, non-profits or individuals to quantify the effects of every food, drug, supplement, and treatment on every measurable aspect of human health and happiness.

The [Nx Monorepo](docs/contributing/repo-structure.md) is to achieve maximum interoperability and minimum duplication of effort between the various 
projects in order to maximize the speed of development and minimize costs.  This can be 
done by modularizing the codebase into libraries and plugins that can be shared between the various projects.

Apps in this monorepo:

- [FDAi-1](apps/dfda-1) - The first version of the decentralized FDA. It is a web app that allows users to track their health data and analyze it to identify the most effective ways to maximize health and happiness.
- Yours? - If you'd like to create the next version of the FDAi, expand its functionality, or get help with your app, feel free to add it to the [apps](apps) folder and submit a pull request.

# FDAi v1 Prototype

We've got a monolithic centralized implementation of the FDAi at [apps/dfda-1](apps/dfda-1) that we're wanting to modularize and decentralize into a set of [FAIR](docs/contributing/fair.md) [libraries](libs) and plugins that can be shared with other apps.

Currently, the main apps are the [Demo Data Collection, Import, and Analysis App](https://app.crowdsourcingcures.org) and the
[Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.crowdsourcingcures.org).

of life-tracking apps and devices. Analyzes data to reveal hidden factors exacerbating or improving symptoms of
chronic illness.

### Web Notifications

Web and mobile push notifications with action buttons.

![web notification action buttons](docs/components/data-collection/web-notification-action-buttons.png)

### Browser Extensions

By using the Browser Extension, you can track your mood, symptoms, or any outcome you want to optimize in a fraction of a second using a unique popup interface.

![Chrome Extension](docs/components/browser-extension/browser-extension.png)

### Data Analysis

The Analytics Engine performs temporal precedence accounting, longitudinal data aggregation, erroneous data filtering, unit conversions, ingredient tagging, and variable grouping to quantify correlations between symptoms, treatments, and other factors.

It then pairs every combination of variables and identifies likely causal relationships using correlation mining algorithms in conjunction with a pharmacokinetic model.  The algorithms first identify the onset delay and duration of action for each hypothetical factor. It then identifies the optimal daily values for each factor.
