# The Cure Acceleration Act

**A blueprint for a world without disease.**

**Section 1: Purpose**  
To reduce the global disease burden by aligning economic incentives with prevention and cure, making all known treatment data transparent, and streamlining patient access to the most effective therapies.

**Section 2: Creation of a Global Decentralized FDA (dFDA)**  
1. The dFDA shall exist as a publicly accessible, secure, and continuously updated database that ranks treatments by proven effectiveness.  
2. It shall gather and analyze time-series health data from patients worldwide: treatment inputs (drugs, diets, etc.) and resulting health outcomes.  
3. The dFDA shall identify and regularly update a list of the top treatments for each condition, based on quality-adjusted life years gained, side effect profiles, and cost-effectiveness.

**Section 3: Patient Access and Participation**  
1. Any patient shall have the right to view the top recommended treatments for their condition through the dFDA.  
2. Patients may order these treatments through licensed providers and opt-in to share their health outcomes.  
3. Data contribution shall be voluntary but incentivized with minimal compensation or recognition. This creates a feedback loop that improves ranking accuracy.

**Section 4: 50/50 Health Savings Sharing Program**  
1. When a new therapy prevents or cures a disease, the resulting healthcare cost savings (estimated via dFDA data) shall be split: 50% returned to society/government payers, 50% awarded to the creators of that therapy.  
2. This profit-sharing aligns corporate and research interests with the mission of eradicating disease rather than profiting from chronic conditions.  
3. All incentives, savings, and reward distributions will be transparently recorded, with metrics made public.

**Section 5: Transparent Public Policy Framework**  
1. The Cure Acceleration Act is a living document posted on a public, wiki-style platform.  
2. It can be refined through democratic amendments: verified participants may propose changes, which are accepted or rejected by majority vote of stakeholders (patients, researchers, payers, and policymakers).  
3. Annual reviews ensure the Act evolves as data, technology, and global health priorities change.

**Section 6: Funding and Adoption**  
1. Initial funding may come from a small percentage of health budgets, forward-thinking self-insured employers, philanthropic organizations, and public-private partnerships.  
2. As successful prevention reduces costs, more payers are expected to join, sustaining and expanding the Actâ€™s reach.  
3. The Act aims to work with existing healthcare systems. Its purpose is not to replace them outright, but to enhance decision-making with reliable data and better incentives.

**Section 7: Compliance and Verification**  
1. Data integrity and patient privacy are paramount. The dFDA shall use secure methods to ensure accuracy and protect personal information.  
2. Independent third parties shall audit data quality, cost-saving calculations, and reward distributions annually, with results published publicly.

**Section 8: Enforcement and Global Cooperation**  
1. Jurisdictions adopting the Act commit to recognizing dFDA treatment rankings and integrating them into their healthcare decision-making.  
2. International organizations and treaties may support alignment, encourage data sharing, and help standardize health metrics, enabling the Act to operate effectively across borders.

**Section 9: Effective Date**  
The Cure Acceleration Act takes effect upon formal adoption by a recognized coalition of healthcare payers, patient advocacy groups, and at least one governing body willing to abide by its principles. Amendments may specify timelines for implementation steps, data integration, and incentive structures.
