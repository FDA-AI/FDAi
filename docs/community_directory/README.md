# FDAi Community Directory

Welcome to the FDAi Community Directory! This repository is designed to facilitate collaboration and organization among various stakeholders involved in the FDAi project. Our goal is to create an open, transparent, and efficient ecosystem where partners from different sectors can come together to contribute to the advancement of decentralized health regulatory processes.

## How to Navigate the Directory

The directory is structured into several high-level folders, each catering to different partner groups and aspects of the project. Here's a brief overview of what you can find in each:

- `/partners`: Contains information pertinent to all partners involved in the FDAi.
- `/researchers`: Dedicated to academic and medical researchers contributing to the project.
- `/healthcare_providers`: For hospitals, clinics, and health apps to share and access relevant information.
- `/developers`: A space for software developers, data scientists, and AI experts to collaborate.
- `/regulatory_legal`: For regulatory experts and legal advisors to discuss and share insights.
- `/patient_advocacy`: Where patient advocacy groups and NGOs can contribute and find resources.
- `/industry_stakeholders`: For pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and other industry players.
- `/community_volunteers`: A place for individual contributors and volunteers to get involved.
- `/funding_sources`: Information about and from investors, grant agencies, and other funding bodies.
- `/projects`: Specific project descriptions, requirements, and collaboration opportunities.
- `/resources`: Shared resources, guides, tools, documentation, coding standards, and data handling protocols.
- `/contributing`: Guidelines on how to contribute to the project, including a code of conduct and contact information.

Each main folder contains a `README.md` file that describes the purpose of the folder and provides instructions on how to add or modify content.

## Contributing to the FDAi

## Templates

To standardize submissions and maintain consistency, we provide templates for various types of contributions:

## Community Engagement

We believe in the power of community. Engage with other partners through discussions, webinars, or online meetings to share insights and collaborate on projects.

## Additional Considerations

- **Accessibility**: We strive to make this directory intuitive and accessible to all, regardless of their familiarity with GitHub.
- **Privacy and Security**: Exercise caution with personal or sensitive information. Refer to our guidelines for what should and shouldn't be shared.
- **Regular Updates**: The community directory is regularly updated to ensure relevance and usefulness. Partners are encouraged to update their pages as needed.

Let's build a healthier future, one contribution at a time.
