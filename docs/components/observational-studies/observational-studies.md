## Overview

Observational studies are a type of study in which researchers observe the behavior of a group of people and measure outcomes. Observational studies do not involve any intervention or manipulation of the subjects, and therefore cannot establish causality. However, they are powerful tools for collecting data to help answer important scientific questions. Observational studies can be used to describe the distribution of a variable among a population, to identify relationships between two or more variables, and to identify risk factors for a disease or other health outcome. Observational studies can be conducted using either a retrospective or a prospective study design.

## Impact

-   Clinicians and those suffering from chronic conditions will have access to the personalized effectiveness rates of treatments and the percent likelihood of root causes.
-  Researchers will be able to use the data to identify the factors that most influence any given aspect of health.
- Anyone wanting to optimize any quantifiable aspect of their life is able to search and see a list of the products that are most effective at helping the average user achieve a particular health and wellness goal. For instance, if one wishes to improve one’s sleep efficiency, go to our site and search for “sleep efficiency”, where one is able to select from the list of products that most affect sleep efficiency.
-  The Personal FDA will be able to use the data to identify the factors that most influence any given aspect of health.
