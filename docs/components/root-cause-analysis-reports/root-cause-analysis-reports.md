# Root Cause Analysis Reports

A half billion are suffering from autoimmune diseases like irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and fibromyalgia.
Another half a billion people are suffering from depression and other mental illnesses.
At least one person will have committed suicide by the time you read this paragraph. (Hopefully, it won't be as a result of reading this paragraph.) Instead, we believe death is due to massive failures in our current systems of clinical research and diagnosis.
Currently, it costs as much as \$48,000 per subject in a Phase III clinical trial. That has resulted in very little data on the effects of any factors that aren’t patentable.

Furthermore, something that most of these chronic conditions have in common is that they can be exacerbated or improved by hundreds of factors during daily life. They can be affected by the hundreds of chemicals you consume through your diet, treatments you've been prescribed, micronutrient intake, nutritional supplements, the amount of time spent in various sleep stages, the type, duration, and intensity of physical activity, social interaction, and even the weather!

Unfortunately, the human mind evolved to survive in a world without data millions of years ago on the African savanna. As a result, our brains are only capable of processing 7 numbers at a given time.
Brains don’t have the bandwidth or statistical processing power required to analyze the massive amount of longitudinal data, time delays, and durations of action that has to be taken into account to determine the influence of each of these factors on the individual’s symptoms.
The good news is that new devices and apps can automate the process of collecting all of this, data and my brain can process millions of numbers!
I love to eat up all this data and analyze it and determine, which of these hundreds of factors have the strongest relationships to the symptom or outcome of interest.
Thus, I automatically generate reports intended to help you and your physician gain insights into the root causes and effective solutions to help you minimize your symptoms.
