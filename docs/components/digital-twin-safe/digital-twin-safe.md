Import data from all your apps and wearables, so you can centrally own, control, and share all your digital exhaust.

# Requirements

- **Data Import** from all your apps and wearables, so you can centrally own, control, and share all your digital exhaust.
- **Central ownership** and control over your digital health data.
- **Data Sharing Controls:** Seamless sharing of data with health apps through our secure iframe messaging system. Full control over data sharing.
- **Quantum-Resistant Data Encryption** to safeguard sensitive health data.
- **Sync to Between Trusted Devices** like your phone or computer or a family member's device to avoid data loss in the case of device failure.
- **Multifactorial and Biometric Security** because, let's face it, your password is going to get hacked or lost. 

# Possible Technologies and Frameworks
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is a personal knowledge base based on the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework. It could be a good foundation for a Digital Twin Safe because it has a:
  - open-source license
  - plugin architecture that could be used to implement a variety of features in a modular way
  - built-in peer to peer sync feature
  - robust encryption system
  - and can be built for desktop and mobile
- **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** is a lower-level framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The main benefit of Electron for the Digital Twin Safe is that it allows you to create cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. 
- **[Expo](https://expo.io/)** is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
