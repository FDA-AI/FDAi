### Preamble

WHEREAS the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is mandated to ensure the safety and efficacy of food, drugs, supplements, and additives consumed by the American public;

WHEREAS the current methodologies for assessing the long-term impacts of these substances are limited and do not fully leverage the potential of modern data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies;

WHEREAS the rapid and inclusive collection of longitudinal health data from a diverse population is crucial for understanding the personalized effects of foods, drugs, supplements, and additives on health outcomes;

WHEREAS the development of an open, interoperable platform for health data sharing, combined with advanced AI-driven analysis, can revolutionize the understanding of health impacts and inform more effective and personalized healthcare decisions;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that:

### Section 1. FDAi Platform Development

The FDA shall fund and oversee the development of the FDAi Platform, an open-source repository and suite of tools designed to:
- Allow for the secure and voluntary sharing of time series data on symptom severity, medication and supplement intake, and dietary intake by individuals.
- Employ causal inference algorithms to generate mega-studies that elucidate the frequency and magnitude of symptoms and health outcomes following exposure to various foods, drugs, supplements, and additives.
- Facilitate the development of predictive models for the personalized effects of these substances on individual health outcomes.

### Section 2. AI Agent for Personalized Health Insights

The FDAi Platform shall include the development of a Personal AI Agent to:
- Assist individuals in understanding the personal effects of the foods, drugs, and supplements they consume.
- Aid physicians in making informed prescribing decisions by providing access to personalized health insights and global mega-study findings.
- Clearly communicate the frequency and severity of all side effects associated with substances, focusing particularly on experimental therapies.

### Section 3. Bill of Patients' Rights

The FDAi Act establishes a Bill of Patients' Rights, asserting that:
- The FDA shall not obstruct the efforts of the sick or dying to seek relief due to a lack of data.
- The FDA must facilitate effortless participation in clinical trials for experimental therapies, striving to minimize the cost burden on participants.
- Data collected from such clinical trials must be rapidly analyzed to determine the safety and efficacy of treatments, thereby informing both the participants and the wider public.

### Section 4. OAuth2 API, Developer Portal, and SDKs

The FDAi Platform shall provide:
- An OAuth2 API and a developer portal to enable any applications and wearable devices to register as data providers.
- SDKs to facilitate the integration of these applications and devices with the FDAi Platform, including mechanisms for users to easily share their health data.

### Section 5. FDAi Platform Components

The FDAi Platform will comprise:
1. **Data Silo API Gateway Nodes:** To enable data exports from health apps and silos into PersonalFDA Nodes.
2. **PersonalFDA Nodes:** Local applications where individuals can securely store their health data and receive personalized insights from their Personal AI Agent.
3. **Clinipedia:** An open-access knowledge repository aggregating global data on the health effects of foods, drugs, supplements, and medical interventions.

### Section 6. Open Source and Collective Intelligence

The FDAi Platform shall be developed as an open-source project to ensure transparency, foster innovation, and leverage collective intelligence in the pursuit of understanding health impacts and improving health outcomes.

### Section 7. Funding

Congress shall allocate the necessary funds for the development, maintenance, and continual improvement of the FDAi Platform and its associated components.

### Section 8. Effective Date

This Act shall take effect immediately upon its passage, with the initial release of the FDAi Platform scheduled for no later than two years from the date of enactment.
