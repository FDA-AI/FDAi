# Why this hasn't been done

Implementing a program like the Health Savings Dividend might seem straightforward, but several real-world complexities have likely prevented it from being adopted on a large scale. Here are some of the primary barriers:

1\. Complexities in Cost Attribution and Savings Verification

Challenge: Accurately attributing long-term healthcare savings to specific treatments is challenging due to the many factors affecting a patient’s health (e.g., lifestyle, other medications, genetic factors).

Solution in the Dividend Model: A global Treatment Outcomes Database (TOD) would address this by gathering and analyzing standardized outcome data, but building and maintaining such a database requires extensive coordination, funding, and ongoing commitment.

2\. Incentive Misalignment in Current Healthcare Structures

Challenge: The current healthcare system often prioritizes short-term profitability over long-term savings. Pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and providers may not be incentivized to develop or distribute affordable, preventative treatments if these don't provide immediate returns.

Solution in the Dividend Model: By rewarding companies with a share of net healthcare savings, this model would realign incentives toward affordable treatments that offer long-term health benefits, although shifting entrenched business practices and financial incentives would still take time.

3\. Complexity of Regulatory and Policy Change

Challenge: Implementing systemic changes like the Health Savings Dividend would require regulatory updates and new legislation, which can be a lengthy process, especially given competing interests in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.

Solution in the Dividend Model: Clear legislation outlining dividend structures, funding for TOD development, and pilot programs could incrementally introduce this model. However, overcoming regulatory inertia would require political will and collaboration across sectors.

4\. Pharmaceutical Revenue Models and Pricing Practices

Challenge: Pharmaceutical companies rely on high prices to recover R\&D costs, especially in the U.S. where drug prices are significantly higher than in other countries. A model encouraging lower prices challenges this traditional revenue approach.

Solution in the Dividend Model: By allowing companies to earn dividends based on the long-term healthcare savings their treatments generate, the model provides a lucrative alternative revenue stream, but it requires a shift in pricing strategies and financial forecasting that some companies may resist.

5\. Data Infrastructure and Privacy Concerns

Challenge: A robust, privacy-compliant data infrastructure like the TOD would require significant investment and rigorous data protection to safeguard patient information. Building such a system also requires buy-in from healthcare providers, insurers, and patients.

Solution in the Dividend Model: Investment in secure, de-identified data protocols and clear privacy protections would be essential, and making this data-sharing model optional but incentivized could encourage gradual adoption.

6\. Uncertainty in Predicting Long-Term Savings

Challenge: Unlike traditional revenue models, long-term savings predictions can be uncertain, and companies may be wary of relying on dividend payouts tied to savings estimates rather than guaranteed sales revenue.

Solution in the Dividend Model: Pilot programs, possibly government-backed, could provide a demonstration of the dividend model's reliability, helping to build trust and encourage industry participation.

Why It’s Worth Exploring Now

Despite these challenges, the Health Savings Dividend model could be increasingly feasible as data infrastructure improves and the need for cost-effective healthcare solutions grows. With advancements in data analytics, machine learning, and secure data-sharing protocols, we are closer than ever to being able to accurately track and reward long-term healthcare savings.

In summary, while structural and practical barriers have likely prevented this kind of model from being adopted widely, recent advances in health data analytics and a shift toward value-based care could make it a viable solution to rising healthcare costs. Pilot programs or public-private partnerships could offer a path forward, demonstrating the model’s potential and building momentum for broader adoption.
