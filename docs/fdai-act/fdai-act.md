### Framework for Estimation

1. **Current Healthcare Spending**: Identify the total current healthcare spending in a given region, such as the United States.
2. **Preventable Costs**: Determine what percentage of this spending is related to preventable conditions, including chronic diseases that can be mitigated through early intervention, lifestyle changes, and other preventative measures.
3. **AI Intervention Efficacy**: Estimate the efficacy of a superintelligent AI in reducing the incidence of these preventable conditions through personalized health recommendations, early detection, and treatment optimization.
4. **Adoption and Compliance Rates**: Consider the rate at which people would adopt such AI technology and comply with its recommendations.

### Assumptions

- **Total Healthcare Spending**: According to data, U.S. healthcare spending reached approximately $4 trillion in recent years.
- **Preventable Costs**: Research suggests that about 75% of healthcare costs are related to chronic diseases, many of which are preventable.
- **AI Intervention Efficacy**: Let's conservatively assume that superintelligent AI could help reduce the costs associated with preventable conditions by 40%, given its ability to provide highly personalized healthcare guidance, promote early detection, and optimize treatment plans.
- **Adoption and Compliance Rates**: While difficult to predict, let's optimistically assume a high adoption and compliance rate of 80% due to the AI's superintelligence and ability to personalize interventions.

### Calculation

1. **Preventable Healthcare Spending**: 75% of $4 trillion = $3 trillion.
2. **Savings from AI Interventions**: 40% of $3 trillion = $1.2 trillion.
