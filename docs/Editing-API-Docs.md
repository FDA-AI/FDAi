# Editing the API Documenation

_Digital Twin Application Programming Interface (DT-API) Specification_

The digital twin API facilitates storage and retrieval of any type of human generated data.

The API is documented in the [OpenAPI Specification](spec.yml) and can be viewed in the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iot-dsa-v2/sdk-dslink-dart/master/express/api/spec.yml).

It can be edited by:

1. downloading Stoplight Studio [here](https://stoplight.io/studio/)
2. opening this repo folder as a local project
