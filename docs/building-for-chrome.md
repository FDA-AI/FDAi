### Building Chrome App

For oAuth authentication, here are the three steps you need to complete:
* Specify the redirection URL in this format https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/<anything-here> For example, if 
your app ID is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef and you want provider_cb to be the path, to distinguish it with redirect 
URIs from other providers, you should use: https://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef.chromiumapp.org/provider_cb

* For uploading the app for the Chrome Web Store you first need to have an active Chrome app developer account, 
that you can create here `https://Chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard/`
* Once you have an active developer account, go to your developer account dashboard and click on add a new item.
* Copy the `www` folder from the project directory to /ChromeApps/{{appname}} directory, create its zip archive and 
upload it to the developer dashboard.
* Fill the details of the app and hit publish button.

### Automated Chrome Web Store Upload
You can use gulp task to simplify the process of building and publishing Chrome app. To use the gulp task you must 
publish it once manually and copy its app id in gulpfile.js like this 
https://github.com/curedao/curedao-web-android-chrome-ios-app-template/blob/develop/gulpfile.js. 

Once you have done that, follow these steps to build, upload, and publish the Chrome app to Webstore.
