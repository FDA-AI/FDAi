# Editing Files in the Browser

If you need any help to get set up, ask @mikepsinn for help in the Discussions forum.  I'd be happy to respond to any questions or have a video call with you.

## Editing Locally

**(recommended if you're going to do a lot of editing)**

If you're comfortable forking, cloning, and editing files locally, and making pull requests, you can skip this section.

However, if that seems like a burden there are a few ways to edit right in your browser.

## Editing Directly on GitHub

**(recommended for beginners or small changes)**

The fastest way is to edit directly on GitHub as illustrated in this [visual walk-through](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Write_a_Constitution_In_a_Democratic_Fashion__XPpT_GzCQC27ouEjEF2oXg).

## Editing in [Prose.io](https://prose.io)

This takes a few steps to set up, but it has a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to avoid using Markdown language.

1. Click the `Fork` button to create your own copy of this repository.
2. Create an account on [Prose.io](https://prose.io).
3. Follow their instructions to link your GitHub account and your forked version of this repo.
4. Edit
5. Create a pull request.

## Editing in Online VS Code

You can also instantly open anything in an online version of VSCode in either of the following ways:

1. Click the `Fork` button to create your own copy of this repository.
2. Press . while browsing YOUR FORKED repository or pull request on GitHub.
3. Edit in VS Code
4. Click the Branch icon on the left
5. Click the plus next to modified files
6. Add a commit description
7. Click check mark to commit
8. Click the sync button at the bottom to upload your changes
9. Open YOUR FORKED repository on GitHub
10. Click "Contribute" to make a pull request back to the main repo.

## Editing in Google Docs (not recommended)

1. Click the `Fork` button to create your own copy of this repository.
2. Copy the file you want to edit to Google Docs.
3. Edit
4. Install and use the "Docs to Markdown" add-on to export to markdown.
5. Open YOUR FORKED repository on GitHub
6. Paste in your repo via the "Editing Directly on GitHub" method above.
7. Commit your changes.
8. Click "Contribute" to make a pull request back to the main repo.

However, that seems like a lot more trouble than it's worth.
