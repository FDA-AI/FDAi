title: Get User Variables
description: Variables are things like treatments or symptoms and include analysis settings and statistics.
---

his function fetches user-defined and public variables based on specified criteria.
Variables can include treatments, symptoms, or any custom user data.
It allows for filtering based on a search phrase, sorting by measurement time.

First, create a `getDfdaAccessToken()` function as [described here](guides/get-access-token) if you haven't done that already.

<Note>
  You can check the [API documentation](../api-reference/variables/get-user-variables) to generate code to do this in any language.

## Common Parameters
| Property      | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| searchPhrase  | Search phrase to filter variables by name or description.                                     |
| includePublic | If true, this also returns variables for which the user has no measurements or reminders yet. |
| sort          | The order in which variables are returned. Default is `-latestMeasurementTime`.               |


```javascript
async function fetchUserVariables(searchPhrase, includePublic = true, limit = 10, offset = 0, sort = '-latestMeasurementTime') {
    const baseUrl = 'https://safe.fdai.earth/api/v3/userVariables';
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
        includePublic: includePublic,
        limit: limit,
        offset: offset,
        searchPhrase: searchPhrase,
        sort: sort
    });

    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}?${params.toString()}`, {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
            'accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${getDfdaAccessToken()}`,
        },
        credentials: 'include'
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return await response.json();
}
```

<Tip>Use the `sort` parameter to manage the order of returned variables, such as by their latest measurement time here.</Tip>
