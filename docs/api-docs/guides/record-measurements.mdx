title: Record Measurements
description: See how to save treatments or symptom ratings for a user

First, [create a user and get an access token](guides/get-access-token) if you haven't done that already.

Then, you can record measurements for a user.

The request should include the user's access token in the `Authorization` header.

There are examples of how to do this in any language in the
[measurement endpoint documentation](../api-reference/measurements/save-measurements).

However, here is an example using javascript:

```javascript


async function postMeasurements(fdaiUser, measurements) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://safe.fdai.earth/api/v1/measurements`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${fdaiUser.accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      measurements
    })
  });
}
```
